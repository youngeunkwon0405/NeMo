    "# Train Your Own Reasoning Model in 48 Hours on a Single GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a tried-and-true recipe for training your own reasoning model by fine-tuning a [Meta LLaMA 3.1‚Äì8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) model with NVIDIA NeMo in about 48 hours on a single H100 80GB GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe is inspired by the [Llama Nemotron family of models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/llama-nemotron/), where the model can selectively turn reasoning on or off based on instructions in the system prompt. You'll train your model on complex instruction-following and reasoning tasks using the [Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ What You'll Learn\n",
    "1. An effective recipe to train your own reasoning model, similar to [Llama Nemotron reasoning models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/foundation-models/llama-nemotron/).\n",
    "2. Apply Fine Tuning with NeMo 2.0, using LoRA adapters or full model fine-tuning.\n",
    "3. Train using NeMo's distributed, mixed-precision trainer.\n",
    "4. Save a fine-tuned checkpoint ready for evaluation or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß∞ Tools and Resources\n",
    "* [NeMo Framework](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/overview.html)\n",
    "* [Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Llama-Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset), an open source dataset for instilling reasoning behavior in large language models.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access to latest NeMo Framework NGC Containers\n",
    "* This playbook has been tested on `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.04.01`. It is expected to work similarly on other environments.\n",
    "* A valid Hugging Face API token with access to the [Meta LLaMa 3.1-8B Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) model (since this is a gated model).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "To follow along, you would need an appropriate reasoning dataset. Checkout the tutorial on [curating the Llama Nemotron Reasoning Dataset with NVIDIA NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/tree/main/tutorials/llama-nemotron-data-curation).\n",
    "You will need the output from that tutorial as the training set input to this playbook!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either fine-tune a LoRA adapter, or fine-tune the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning via LoRA adapters**: \n",
    "  * This playbook has been verified on **a single H100 80GB** when PEFT is enabled.\n",
    "  * It takes **48 hours** to train the model for 2000 steps and observe reasoning behavior.\n",
    "* **Full Fine-Tuning**:\n",
    "  * This playbook has been tested on **8xH100 80GB** GPUs. You can scale training to more GPUs as well as multiple nodes by modifying the appropriate parameters.\n",
    "  * It takes **12 hours** to train the model for 2000 steps and observe reasoning behavior.\n",
