    "## Optimizing Foundation Models with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we want to adapt or customize foundation models to be more performant on our specific task. Fine-tuning refers to how we can modify the weights of a pre-trained foundation model with additional custom data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) refers to unfreezing all the weights and layers in our model and training on a newly labeled set of examples. We can fine-tune to incorporate new, domain-specific knowledge, or teach the foundation model what type of response to provide. One specific type of SFT is also referred to as “instruction tuning” where we use SFT to teach a model to follow instructions better. In this tutorial, will demonstrate how to perform SFT with Llama3-8b using NeMo 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo 2.0 introduces Python-based configurations, PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, and NeMo-Run for scaling experiments across multiple GPUs. In this notebook, we will use NeMo-Run to streamline the configuration and execution of our experiments.\n",
