    "## Optimizing Foundation Models with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to demonstrate how to adapt or customize foundation models to improve performance on specific tasks using NeMo 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimization process is known as fine-tuning, which involves adjusting the weights of a pre-trained foundation model with custom data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that foundation models can be significantly large, a variant of fine-tuning has gained traction recently known as PEFT. PEFT encompasses several methods, including P-Tuning, LoRA, Adapters, IA3, etc. NeMo 2.0 currently supports [Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo 2.0 introduces Python-based configurations, PyTorch Lightningâ€™s modular abstractions, and NeMo-Run for scaling experiments across multiple GPUs. In this notebook, we will use NeMo-Run to streamline the configuration and execution of our experiments.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "This notebook uses the SQuAD dataset. For more details about the data, refer to [SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)\n",

As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \\\"golden anniversary\\\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \\\"Super Bowl L\\\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50.
