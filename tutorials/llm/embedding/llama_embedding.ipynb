    "# Finetuning Llama 3.2 Model into Embedding Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLaMA 3.2 is a powerful large language model (LLM) pre-trained on diverse datasets, its application to specific downstream tasks—such as semantic search, document retrieval, or natural language understanding—requires adapting the model to effectively generate dense vector representations (embeddings). In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to finetune this model and convert it into a state-of-the-art embedding model for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key architectural change involves modifying the LLaMA model to optimize its performance in generating embeddings by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention. This change enables the decoder-only model to create embeddings that are contextually relevant, semantically rich, and capable of improving the efficiency and accuracy of tasks like information retrieval, clustering, and text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primary goals for this tutorial are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Demonstrate the ease of automatically converting the model with essential architectural changes for embedding model training\n",
    " * Improve the model's performance and accuracy in generating dense vector representations (embeddings)\n",
    " * Provide guidelines for finetuning embedding models, including hyperparameter choices.\n"
