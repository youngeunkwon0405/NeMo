        "\n",
        "Canary is a class of multilingual multitask speech-to-text models based on the attention encoder-decoder (AED) architecture. Currently, NVIDIA's Canary family of models includes `canary-1b`, `canary-1b-flash`, and `canary-180m-flash`. The Canary family of models use FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder. `canary-1b-flash` is a faster and more accurate version of `canary-1b`, attained by increasing the size of the encoder and reducing the size of the decoder, thus improving speed while maintaining comparable model capacity. In this tutorial, we will focus on the Canary-flash models.\n",

        "`canary-1b-flash`, and `canary-180m-flash` are multilingual multitask models with 883M and 182M parameters respectively. These models support speech recognition in English, German, French, Spanish, and translation from English to German/French/Spanish and from German/French/Spanish to English with or without punctuation and capitalization (PnC). Canary-Flash models also support word-level timestamp prediction for English, German, French, and Spanish.\n",
