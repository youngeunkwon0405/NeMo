def masked_cross_entropy(logits, targets, mask=None, fp32_upcast=True, ignore_index=-100):
    """
    Compute the masked cross-entropy loss between logits and targets.

    If a mask is provided, the loss is computed per element, multiplied by the mask,
    and then averaged. If no mask is provided, the standard cross-entropy loss is used.

    Args:
        logits (torch.Tensor): The predicted logits with shape (N, C) where C is the number of classes.
        targets (torch.Tensor): The ground truth class indices with shape (N,).
        mask (torch.Tensor, optional): A tensor that masks the loss computation. Items marked with
            1 will be used to calculate loss, otherwise ignored. Must be broadcastable to the shape
            of the loss. Defaults to None.
        fp32_upcast (bool, optional): if True it will cast logits to float32 before computing
        cross entropy. Default: True.
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: The computed loss as a scalar tensor.
