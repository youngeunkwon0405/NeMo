## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo Framework is a scalable and cloud-native generative AI
framework built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Large
Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV)
domains. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and
deploy new generative AI models by leveraging existing code and
pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).

## What's New in NeMo 2.0

NVIDIA NeMo 2.0 introduces several significant improvements over its predecessor, NeMo 1.0, enhancing flexibility, performance, and scalability.

- **Python-Based Configuration** - NeMo 2.0 transitions from YAML files to a Python-based configuration, providing more flexibility and control. This shift makes it easier to extend and customize configurations programmatically.

- **Modular Abstractions** - By adopting PyTorch Lightning’s modular abstractions, NeMo 2.0 simplifies adaptation and experimentation. This modular approach allows developers to more easily modify and experiment with different components of their models.

- **Scalability** - NeMo 2.0 seamlessly scaling large-scale experiments across thousands of GPUs using [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run), a powerful tool designed to streamline the configuration, execution, and management of machine learning experiments across computing environments.

Overall, these enhancements make NeMo 2.0 a powerful, scalable, and user-friendly framework for AI model development.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> NeMo 2.0 is currently supported by the LLM (large language model) and VLM (vision language model) collections.

### Get Started with NeMo 2.0

### Get Started with Cosmos

NeMo Curator and NeMo Framework support video curation and post-training of the Cosmos World Foundation Models, which are open and available on [NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/cosmos/collections/cosmos) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/cosmos-6751e884dc10e013a0a0d8e6). For more information on video datasets, refer to [NeMo Curator](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-curator). To post-train World Foundation Models using the NeMo Framework for your custom physical AI tasks, see the [Cosmos Diffusion models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/diffusion/nemo/post_training/README.md) and the [Cosmos Autoregressive models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Cosmos/blob/main/cosmos1/models/autoregressive/nemo/post_training/README.md).

## LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization

All NeMo models are trained with
[Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Training is
automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the
latest NeMo Framework container [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/performance/performance_summary.html).

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training
techniques, incorporating [parallelism
strategies](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html)
to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques
include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully
Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed
Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize [NVIDIA Transformer
Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) for FP8 training on
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging [NVIDIA Megatron
Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) for
scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM,
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF). See [NVIDIA NeMo
Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the
latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA,
P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html)
for the full list of supported models and techniques.

```

### NGC PyTorch container

**NOTE: The following steps are supported beginning with 24.04 (NeMo-Toolkit 2.3.0)**

We recommended that you start with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container:
nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3.

If starting with a base NVIDIA PyTorch container, you must first launch
the container:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:${NV_PYTORCH_TAG:-'nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3'}
```

From [NVIDIA/NeMo](github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo), fetch the commit/branch/tag that you want to install.  
To install nemo_toolkit including all of its dependencies from this Git reference `$REF`, use the following installation method:

```bash
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo
cd NeMo
git checkout ${REF:-'main'}
bash docker/common/install_dep.sh --library all
pip install ".[all]"
```

## NGC NeMo container

NeMo containers are launched concurrently with NeMo version updates.
NeMo Framework now supports LLMs, MMs, ASR, and TTS in a single
consolidated Docker container. You can find additional information about
released containers on the [NeMo releases
page](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/releases).

To use a pre-built container, run the following code:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \
  -it \
  --rm \
  --shm-size=16g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:${NV_PYTORCH_TAG:-'nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.02'}
```

## Future Work

The NeMo Framework Launcher does not currently support ASR and TTS
training, but it will soon.
