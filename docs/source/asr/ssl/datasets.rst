Datasets
========

Any dataset available in NeMo for ASR (:doc:`ASR datasets <../datasets>`) can be used for SSL. 
To create your own NeMo compatible datasets, refer to 
:ref:`Preparing Custom ASR Data <section-with-manifest-format-explanation>`  
section. Note that explicit labels (transcriptions) are not utilized in SSL and hence are optional 
when creating datasets for SSL.
